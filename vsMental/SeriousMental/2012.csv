"Table 23. Serious Mental Illness in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2011 and 2012 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,
"Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and resulted in serious functional impairment. For details, see Section B of the ""2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k12State/NSDUHsae2012/Index.aspx.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,
