"Table 23. Had at Least One Major Depressive Episode in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2005 and 2006 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Major depressive episode is defined as in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), which specifies a period of at least 2 weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and had a majority of specified depression symptoms. For details, see Section A.11 in Appendix A of the report on State Estimates of Substance Use and Mental Disorders from the 2009-2010 NSDUHs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: There are minor wording differences in the questions in the adult and adolescent major depressive episode modules. Therefore, data from youths aged 12 to 17 were not combined with data from persons aged 18 or older to produce an estimate for those aged 12 or older. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: The 2005-2006 estimates may differ from estimates published prior to 2012 due to updates (see Section 1.5 of the report on State Estimates of Substance Use and Mental Disorders from the 2009-2010 NSDUHs). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
