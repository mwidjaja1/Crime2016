"Table 24. Any Mental Illness in the Past Year, by State and Age Group: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2010 and 2011 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Any Mental Illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, that met the criteria found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Estimates for AMI presented in this table may differ from previously published AMI estimates because of revised estimation procedures. For details, see the NSDUH short report titled Revised Estimates of Mental Illness from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health at http://samhsa.gov/data/default.aspx.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""National"" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,
